# Linux Notes

## Why Linux matters in Cloud
Most cloud servers run Linux. Understanding the command line is essential for
managing services, troubleshooting, and automation.

## File Permissions
Linux uses three permission levels:
- User
- Group
- Others

Each level can have:
- Read (r)
- Write (w)
- Execute (x)
